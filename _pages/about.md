I am currently doing my master's in computational neuroscience in Berlin, focusing on probabilistic machine learning and causality to learn from biomedical data. Despite progress in predictive analytics such models often rely on purely statistical associations. Causality is a novel approach front in ML for transparent and unbiased models that hope to tackle these barriers for clinical uses of ML. I am working on my final lab rotation at the Klaus Robert MÃ¼ller lab for Machine Learning to investigate causal discovery for fair facial image generation.

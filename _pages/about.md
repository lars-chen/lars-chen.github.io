I am currently doing my master's in computational neuroscience in Berlin. My research interests lie in the application of probabilistic machine learning and the integration of causal information to learn from biomedical data. Despite progress in predictive analytics such models often rely on purely statistical associations
and are susceptible to learning spurious correlations in training data which leads to poor clinical outcomes. Incorporating causal information in ML is a novel approach for transparent and unbiased models that hopes to tackle these barriers for clinical uses of ML. I am currently applying deep probabilistic methods for causal inference.

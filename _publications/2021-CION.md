We developed a simple, one-pot recipe to synthesize Carboxymethyl-dextran coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, namely, “CION”, suitable for preclinical CBV-MRI applications. Here we disseminate a step-by-step instruction of our one-pot synthesis protocol, which allows CION to be produced in laboratories with minimal cost. My contribution was the synthesis and characterization of different CION-conjugations by manipulating polymer to metal ratio in terms of their size, and shifts in MR relaxivity. I also worked on demonstrating CION can serve as a cross-modality research platform by showing concurrent in vivo optical and MRI measurements of CBV using fluorescent-labeled CION. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of our one-pot synthesis method should allow researchers to reproduce CION and tailor the relaxivity and pharmacokinetics according to their imaging needs.

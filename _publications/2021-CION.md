We developed a simple, one-pot recipe to synthesize Carboxymethyl-dextran coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, namely, “CION”, for preclinical CBV-MRI applications. My contribution was the synthesis and characterization of different CION conjugations. I also investigated a cross-modality platform by showing concurrent in vivo optical and MRI measurements of CBV using fluorescent-labeled CION. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of our one-pot synthesis method make CION easily reproducible.

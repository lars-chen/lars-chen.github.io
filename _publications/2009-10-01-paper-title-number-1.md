Soybean cyst nematode is the most damaging pest of soybean worldwide. The molecular mechanism of SCN resistance remains largely unknown. We conducted a global RNA-seq comparison between a resistant genotype and a susceptible genotype of Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of soybean, to understand its regulatory network in defense. My contribution was the validation of RNA-seq results using the gold standard reverse transcriptase qPCR in select genes.
